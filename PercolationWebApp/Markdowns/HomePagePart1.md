# <center>Percolation</center>

Percolation is a theory studying the behavior of connected clusters in a random system. It provides insight into a wide range of phenomena, like physics, mathematics and recently epidemiology.

The basic idea is to generate a grid of square sites, where each one of them can be occupied or not with a certain probability $p$. If many sites are occupied next to each other, they form a cluster. With increasing site occupation probability theese clusters grow larger. At a certain critical probability $p_c$ the cluster spans the entire system. We call this probability the <i>percolation threshold.</i> Mathematically, for infinite 2D system this percolation is equal:

### <center>$$p_c \approx 0.592756$$</center>

In this project we're going to use Monte Carlo techniques to analyze phase transitions and clustering at various site occupation probabilities.
